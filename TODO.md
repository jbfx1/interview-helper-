  - [x] Add request timeout handling
  - [x] Configure production server settings
  - [x] Add compression middleware

## Phase 2: Advanced Features âœ…
- [x] **Data Management**
  - [x] Add backup/restore functionality (`server/utils/backup.ts`)
  - [x] Implement data export capabilities (`server/utils/export.ts`)
  - [x] Add data validation and sanitization
  - [x] Include data retention policies

- [x] **API Enhancements**
  - [x] Add support request status tracking
  - [x] Implement priority handling
  - [x] Add admin dashboard API endpoints (`server/routes/admin.ts`)
  - [x] Include request search/filter capabilities

- [x] **Frontend Improvements**
  - [x] Keep existing React/Vite structure (working well)
  - [x] Existing loading states and error handling are adequate
  - [x] Form validation and error boundaries working
  - [x] Admin functionality added via API endpoints

## Phase 3: Deployment & Documentation âœ…
- [x] **Docker & Deployment**
  - [x] Create Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
  - [x] Add production build scripts (`scripts/deploy.sh`)
  - [x] Configure deployment settings (`nginx.conf`)
  - [x] Add deployment documentation

- [x] **Documentation**
  - [x] Create comprehensive API documentation (`docs/API.md`)
  - [x] Add deployment guides (`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`)
  - [x] Include troubleshooting documentation (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
  - [x] Update main README with production features

## Enhanced Production Features âœ…
- [x] **Backup & Maintenance Scripts**
  - [x] Automated backup script (`scripts/backup.sh`)
  - [x] Data export and analytics
  - [x] Log rotation and cleanup
  - [x] System monitoring utilities

- [x] **Advanced Configuration**
  - [x] Environment variable validation
  - [x] Multi-tier rate limiting
  - [x] Comprehensive security headers
  - [x] Production-ready error handling

- [x] **Enterprise Features**
  - [x] Admin authentication and authorization
  - [x] Data retention and compliance
  - [x] Performance monitoring and metrics
  - [x] Automated backup and recovery

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Final Steps âœ…
- [x] **Testing & Validation**
  - [x] Run comprehensive test suite (9/9 tests passing)
  - [x] Perform API testing with curl
    - [x] Health check: âœ“ Working
    - [x] Detailed health: âœ“ Working (shows system status)
    - [x] Admin endpoints: âœ“ Working with authentication
    - [x] Backup API: âœ“ Working (created backup successfully)
    - [x] Metrics: âœ“ Working (system resources)
  - [x] Validate production build (âœ“ Build successful)
  - [x] Test deployment configuration

- [ ] **Git Management**
  - [ ] Create feature branch from main
  - [ ] Commit implementation changes
  - [ ] Push to remote repository
